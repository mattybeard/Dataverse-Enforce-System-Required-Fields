# Dataverse - Enforce System Required Fields
An example plugin to enforce system required fields at server level.

## What does it do?
Dataverse allows users to specify fields to be system required but only actually enforce that through client side javascript meaning it's very easy to bypass if you wanted to do so.

This code is provided as an idea of what you could do to enforce this requirement at a server level, making it much more difficult to bypass this requirement regardless of route into the system.
